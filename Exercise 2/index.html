        <li>There is a missing ";" behind the "2px" in the first Div's style tag, which is creating a syntax error. </li>
        <li>After the registered trademark logo, the delivery system text is being affected by the superscript HTML tag, and it shouldn't be. It is because the superscript tag on that line of code hasn't been properly closed.</li>
        <li>There is a missing quotation mark to close the a link tag target, so the tag information is spilling into the page instead of being contained within the intented "Perscribing Information" text.</li>
        <li>That random dot in the warning box should be an un-ordered list item, and spaced appropriately. The text size should also be different than the rest of the information on the page.</li>
        <li>The "Prescription use of this product is limited under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act." text is not placed in any appropriate html5 tags. (p, h1, etc.)</li>
        <li>Too many bold b tags, and not enough paragraph p tags?</li>
        <li>There isn't any boilerplate HTML5 doctype code, so I don't think the internet will know what's happening in the first place!</li>
